    <h1>Mailing lists for exim</h1>

    <p>There are three mailing lists for users of Exim.  Signing up for
      these is via a web form.  The three lists are:-</p>
    <dl>
      <dt><b><a
     href="http://lists.exim.org/mailman/listinfo/exim-announce">exim-announce</a></b></dt>
      <dd>which is a low volume moderated list consisting of
 announcements only of things of interest to exim users
 (typically new releases).  There is an <a href="http://lists.exim.org/lurker/list/exim-announce.html">archive</a> of messages
 since July 1999.</dd>
      <dt><b><a
     href="http://lists.exim.org/mailman/listinfo/exim-dev">exim-dev</a></b></dt>

      <dd>which is a list dedicated to the ongoing development process
      for exim.  It is not the grown-up version of the users list.
      There are searchable <a
      href="http://lists.exim.org/lurker/list/exim-dev.html">archives</a>
      covering postings back to 2004.
      </dd>

      <dt><b><a
     href="http://lists.exim.org/mailman/listinfo/exim-users">exim-users</a></b></dt>
      <dd>which is a discussion list about exim covering use and
      development of the software.  This also has a searchable <a
      href="http://lists.exim.org/lurker/list/exim-users.html">archive</a>
      covering postings back to 1996.  Please have the courtesy to check the list
      before posting basic queries, the <a
      href="exim-html-4.40/doc/html/FAQ.html">FAQ</a> also covers many
      things that get asked regularly on the list.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>In addition, there is a fresh mailing list dedicated to the
      discussion of the future of Exim:</p>
    <dl>
     <dt><b><a
     href="http://lists.exim.org/mailman/listinfo/exim-future">exim-future</a></b></dt>
     <dd>This list is intended for discussions of future development methodology
     and features aimed at Exim 5 onwards - i.e. anything that involves
     architectural changes. There are additionally some <a href="http://wiki.exim.org/Exim5">wiki pages</a> recording
     ideas as they get fleshed out (which may involve several alternatives).</dd>
