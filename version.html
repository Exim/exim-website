    <h1>Versions of exim</h1>

    <p>The latest release is <b>4.02</b>.  This is a major upgrade
    over the 3.x versions which will require configuration files to be
    rewritten (there are tools to help with this).  As an early
    release of a major new version cautious users may wish to test
    carefully before moving to production services.  <b>4.02</b> and
    <b>4.01</b> are a bug fix releases over <b>4.00</b></p>

    <p>The latest 3.x release is <b>3.35</b>.  This is the latest bug fix
    release in the 3.3x series.  They are an incremental upgrade over
    the 3.2x series with a few new features.  There is a security
    issue (rare but exploitable) with versions previous to 3.34
    so upgrading is <b>strongly</b> recommended.
    Old 3.0x configuration files should be fully compatible.
    New features are documented in the CHANGES and NewStuff files.</p>

    <p>The previous 3.2x release is <b>3.22</b>.  This is an
    incremental upgrade with a small number of new features and some
    bug fixes, however old 3.0x configuration files should be fully
    compatible.  New features are documented in the CHANGES and
    NewStuff files Upgrading from previous releases is worth doing,
    particularly since a denial-of-service hole has been fixed over
    3.0x and lower versions.</p>

    <p>There were a number of early beta versions of exim with version
    numbers less than <b>1.0</b>.  These should now be avoided.
    Versions earlier than <b>2.0x</b> should also be upgraded.
    Version 3.0x and 3.1x releases are also best upgraded.</p>

    <p>There may be beta versions with available from the ftp sites in
    the Testing directory.  Many people are using these without
    problems, but they are not recommended unless you are willing to
    work with beta software.</p>
