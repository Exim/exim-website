    <h1>Versions of exim</h1>

    <p>The latest release is <b>4.60</b>.  This is a bug fix and
    features release in the <b>4.xx</b> series of releases - see the
    <a href="mirrors.html">download</a> pages.  Documentation has been
    updated for 4.60.  Versions 4.43 and prior had some security
    related bugs and should either be <a
    href="http://www.exim.org/mail-archives/exim-announce/2005/msg00000.html">patched</a>
    or updated to 4.44 or later</p>

    <p>New features are documented in the <a
    href="ftp/ChangeLogs/ChangeLog-4.60"><tt>doc/ChangeLog</tt></a> and <a
    href="ftp/ChangeLogs/NewStuff-4.60"><tt>doc/NewStuff</tt></a> files within
    the distribution.  These files are also available separately from
    the main package files on the main ftp site and its mirrors in the
    <a href="ftp/ChangeLogs/"><tt>ChangeLogs</tt></a> directory - see
    the <a href="mirrors.html">download</a> pages.</p>

    <p> All versions of exim previous to version <b>4.x</b> are now
    considered obsolete and everyone is <b>strongly</b> recommended to
    upgrade to a current release.</p>

    <p>The last 3.x release was <b>3.36</b>.</p>

    <p>There may be beta versions with available from the ftp sites in
    the Testing directory.  Many people are using these without
    problems, but they are not recommended unless you are willing to
    work with beta software.</p>
