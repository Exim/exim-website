Summary
-------
Six 0day exploits were filed against Exim.

None of these issues is related to transport security (TLS) being
on or off.

* 3 of them are related to SPA/NTLM, and EXTERNAL auth. If you do not
  use SPA/NTLM, or EXTERNAL authentication, you're not affected.  These
  issues are fixed.

* One issue is related to data received from a proxy-protocol proxy. If
  you do not use a proxy in front of Exim, you're not affected. If your
  proxy is trustworthy, you're not affected. We're working on a fix.

* One is related to libspf2. If you do not use the `spf` lookup type or
  the `spf` ACL condition, you are not affected.

* The last one is related to DNS lookups. If you use a trustworthy
  resolver (which does validation of the data it receives), you're not
  affected. We're working on a fix.

Schedule
--------
Currently we're in contact with the major distros and aim to release
those fixes that are available as soon as possible. (Aiming Monday, Oct
2nd.)
