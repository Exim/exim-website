    <h1>HOWTO - Using the RBL</h1>

    <p>The MAPS (Mail Abuse Protection System) RBL (Realtime Blackhole
      List) is a means of identifying hosts that have been associated
      with the sending of spam mail.  A full description of the
      service and the technology and ethics behind it can be found at
      <a href="http://maps.vix.com/rbl/"><tt>http://maps.vix.com/rbl/</tt></a>
      along with more general mail policy information at
      <a href="http://maps.vix.com/"><tt>http://maps.vix.com/</tt></a>.</p>

    <p>Exim can use the MAPS RBL and/or any other similarly defined
      service (ie you could make your own additional maps as well).
      To use exim for this you need to be running version 1.80 or
      later.</p>

    <p>This documentation is for versions of exim before version 3.00,
    which are now considered obsolete.  The current information can be
    found in the <a href="rbl.html">most recent version of this
    howto</a>.</p>

    <h2>RBL Configuration Options</h2>

    <p>These are fully detailed in the <a href="../exim-html-3.00/doc/html/spec.html"
    target="_top">Exim Specification Document</a>. The specific
    section on RBL is <a
    href="../exim-html-3.00/doc/html/spec_39.html#SEC708">here</a> and the rbl directives
    are documented starting <a href="../exim-html-3.00/doc/html/spec_10.html#SEC283">here</a></p>

    <p>The 2 standard RBL configurations are:-</p>
    <ol>

      <li>Use RBL to add a <tt>X-RBL-Warning:</tt> header which can be
 used by users for filtering
<pre>
rbl_domains = rbl.maps.vix.com
no_rbl_reject_recipients
rbl_warn_header
</pre>

      </li>
      <li>Use the RBL to reject mail from barred machines
<pre>
rbl_domains = rbl.maps.vix.com
rbl_reject_recipients
</pre>
 </li>
    </ol>
    <p>In both cases machines can be explicitly removed from RBL
      control by adding their network addresses to the
      <tt>rbl_except_nets</tt> list.</p>

    <p>The information to do more complicated manipulations can be
      found in the specification document and is outside the scope of
      this note.</p>
