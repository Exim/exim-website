    <h1>Mirroring the Exim web site</h1> 

    <h2>Mirroring the content</h2> 

    <p>All of the exim web site content is available through rsync,
    and this is the recommended means for mirroring the web site
    content.  A document describing <a
    href="http://www.sunsite.auc.dk/SunSITE/rsync/rsync-mirroring.html">rsync
    mirroring</a> has been produced by <a
    href="http://www.sunsite.auc.dk/">Sunsite Denmark</a>, and this
    gives good general information on rsync in general, where to
    obtain the software, as well as rsync for mirroring.</p>

    <p>The rsync URL is <a href="rsync://ftp.exim.org/www">
	rsync://ftp.exim.org/www </a></p>

    <p>However the more normal means to quote the rsync path is
    <tt>ftp.exim.org::www</tt></p>

    <p>The rsync path for the ftp area is
    <tt>ftp.exim.org::ftp</tt></p>

    <h2>Configuring your httpd</h2>

    <p>Your httpd obviously needs to see the mirrored content.  There
    are also some other tweaks - Apache aliases - which are needed.
    The paths that need aliasing are currently only the <tt>/ftp></tt>
    path which either needs pointing to your ftp mirror, or
    redirecting to a reasonable mirror of the exim ftp site.</p>

    <p>If and when the mailing list archives are put on line, these
      may also need handling in a special way.</p>

    <h2>Branding your site</h2>

    <p>In some small recognition of the ISPs and other organisations
      who donate the web site space, bandwidth and management, the web 
      site has a brandable component - specifically the bottom left
      hand pane of the main window points to the
      <tt>branding/branding.html</tt> file.  By aliasing this path you 
      can tailor this to put a sponsors logo in place.</p>

    <h2>Tell people about it</h2>

    <p>Assuming this is a public mirror then contact me about it and I
    will add a link from the main site.  I can also get a
    <tt>www.<i>country</i>.exim.org</tt> link added to the DNS for
    you.  You may also wish to send one message to the mailing list
    about this.</p>
