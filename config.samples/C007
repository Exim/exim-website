If I host a domain foo.dom on my machine as a virtual domain I expect it
to be completely virtual and seperate from other mail domains that end
up on my machine. pir@foo.dom may or may not be me ...

I have separate aliasfiles per domain (because its faster and more
suitable to my application) and use:

# I move this config between different db implementations that either do
# or don't expect the .db extension.
DBEXT = .db
#DBEXT = 

local_domains = "....:dbm;/usr/local/etc/exim/dbm/virtualDBEXT:..."

As the first director:

# deal with virtual domains.
virtual:
  driver = aliasfile
  domains = dbm;/usr/local/etc/exim/dbm/virtualDBEXT
  no_more
  rewrite = false
  file = /usr/local/etc/exim/domains/${lc:${length_1:${domain}}/${domain}}DBEXT
  search_type = dbm*
