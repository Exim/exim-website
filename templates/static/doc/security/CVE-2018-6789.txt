CVE-2018-6789
=============

There is a buffer overflow in base64d(), if some pre-conditions are met.
Using a handcrafted message, remote code execution seems to be possible.

A patch exists already and is being tested.

Currently we're unsure about the severity, we *believe*, an exploit
is difficult. A mitigation isn't known.
