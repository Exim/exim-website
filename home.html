    <h1>The Exim Home Page</h1> 

    <p>Exim is a message transfer agent (<b>MTA</b>) developed at the
    University of Cambridge for use on Unix systems connected to the
    Internet. It is freely available under the terms of the <b>GNU
    General Public Licence</b>. In style it is similar to <b>Smail
    3</b>, but its facilities are more extensive, and in particular it
    has some defences against mail bombs and unsolicited junk mail in
    the form of options for refusing messages from particular hosts,
    networks, or senders.  It can be installed in place of sendmail,
    although the configuration of exim is quite different to that of
    sendmail.</p>

    <p>An expanded <a href="intro.html">introduction is available</a>.</p>

	available at <a href="ftp://ftp.exim.org/pub/filter/">
	ftp://ftp.exim.org/pub/filter/</a> or <A
	HREF="system_filter.exim">here</A>.  This is an exim system
	filter which attempts to detect executables including the
	types responsible for the Windows/Outlook mail worms, and also
	the recent bugs with header length checking (see this <A
	HREF="http://www.securityfocus.com/frames/?content=/templates/article.html%3Fid%3D61">
	BugTraq article</A>).  It is not infallible, but many sites
	may find it useful.  The file contains installation
	instructions.  Version 0.13 released on 22 May.
      </li>
