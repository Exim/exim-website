This is the Exim configuration file of a machine which delivers mail to several
local domains, where the mail is delivered locally, several hairy domains,
handled as described below, and a half-virtual domain, which is first processed
by its special alias file, then processed as other local domains (including the
processing by the global alias file).

This contribution consists of a number of files that are in the tar archive 
C022.tar, which unpacks into a directory called "hairy". See the README file 
therein for an explanation of the configuration.
