    <h1>The Exim Home Page</h1>

    <p>Exim is a message transfer agent (<b>MTA</b>) developed at the
    University of Cambridge for use on Unix systems connected to the
    Internet. It is freely available under the terms of the <b>GNU
    General Public Licence</b>. In style it is similar to <b>Smail
    3</b>, but its facilities are more general.  There is a great deal
    of flexibility in the way mail can be routed, and there are
    extensive facilities for checking incoming mail. Exim can be
    installed in place of sendmail, although the configuration of exim
    is quite different to that of sendmail.</p>

    <h2>Exim Course</h2>

    <p>The University of Cambridge Computing Service is hosting a
    seventh <a
    href="http://www-tus.csx.cam.ac.uk/courses/exim/">course on the
    Exim Mail Transfer Agent</a> on Tuesday 12th July to Friday 15th
    July 2005 in Robinson College, Cambridge. The course has been
    extended to 3 days. The course is suitable for those new to Exim
    as well as more experienced users. In addition to Dr Philip Hazel,

    <h2>Current Versions</h2>
    <p>
      The current version of Exim is <b>4.51</b>.  See the <a
      href="mirrors.html"><b>Download</b></a> page to get a copy.
      There are security issues fixed in this version so all users are
      encouraged to upgrade.
    </p>

    <p>Exim 3 and previous versions are now considered obsolete.  Exim 3
    is not being developed any further, nor is it being actively
    maintained, though if a really serious bug were found, it would be
    looked at.</p>

    <p>The old system filter has been deleted from the site - it is
    not appropriate for current mail configurations.  If you are still
    using it please discontinue immediately - it creates severe
    collateral spam issues.</p>

    <h2>Exim Bugzilla</h2>

    <p>If you find a bug in Exim or the documentation, please register
    a bug in the <a href="http://www.exim.org/bugzilla/">Exim
    Bugzilla</a></p>

    <h2>Mailman</h2>

    <p>The <a href="howto/mailman21.html">Exim/Mailman HOWTO</a> for
      Mailman 2.1 with Exim 4 has been rewritten.</p>

    <h2>Exim Books</h2>

    <p>The new <a href="http://www.uit.co.uk/exim-book/"> Exim 4
    book</a> is available.  See the <a
    href="http://www.uit.co.uk/exim-book/">book website</a> for
    further information.</p>

    <p>The O'Reilly <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/exim/">Exim 3
 book</a> is still available.</p>
