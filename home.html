    <h1>The Exim Home Page</h1> 

    <p>Exim is a message transfer agent (<b>MTA</b>) developed at the
    University of Cambridge for use on Unix systems connected to the
    Internet. It is freely available under the terms of the <b>GNU
    General Public Licence</b>. In style it is similar to <b>Smail
    3</b>, but its facilities are more general.  There is a great deal
    of flexibility in the way mail can be routed, and there are
    extensive facilities for checking incoming mail. Exim can be
    installed in place of sendmail, although the configuration of exim
    is quite different to that of sendmail.</p>

    <p>An expanded <a href="intro.html">introduction is available</a>.</p>

    <h2>New Things</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Please note that this web site is updated asynchronously with
	  exim releases, and may sometimes trail versions by a few days or
	  even weeks</i></li>
      <li>
	Current Exim versions are <b>3.36</b> and <b>4.10</b>, both of
	which are bug fix releases over the previous versions.
      </li>
      <li>
	A <b>Generic Windows Executable Content</b> filter is
	available at <a href="ftp://ftp.exim.org/pub/filter/">
	ftp://ftp.exim.org/pub/filter/</a> or <A
	HREF="system_filter.exim">here</A>.  This is an exim system
	filter which attempts to detect Windows executables, and block
	the messages containing them.  It has limitations - specifically
	related to trying to parse MIME with regular expressions,
	but many people are using it as a cheap means of protection.
	<b>NB this is no longer being maintained.</b>
       </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>OSDir.com site</h2> 
    <p>There is an <a href="http://osdir.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Downloads&file=index&req=viewdownloaddetails&lid=140&ttitle=Exim">
	entry for exim</a> on O'Reilly's <a
	hred="http://OSDir.com">OSDir.com</a> site.  At the time of
	writing this has very little content, but people may wish to
	correct that...</p>

    <h2>Exim Book</h2>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/exim/">definitive exim book</a>, 
      written by Philip Hazel, is now available.  Orders can
      be placed through a number of the on-line retailers.</p>
