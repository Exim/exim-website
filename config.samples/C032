Exim Nervous Mailbox Quota Suite version 1999-11-08

This is the Exim Nervous Mailbox Quota Suite.  It does not impose
hard quotas on users' mailboxes, but it makes a user nervous by
putting all his mail in a secondary mailbox, inaccessible to the
user, when he is over his quota.  When the user clears his
mailbox (i.e., deletes mail to make his mailbox below the quota
again), mail from his secondary mailbox is transferred back to
his primary mailbox, in FIFO order.

The files that make up this configuration sample are contained
in C032.tar.
