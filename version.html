    <p>The latest release is <b>4.20</b>.  This is a minor upgrade
    on the <b>4.1x</b> series of releases, however the documentation
    has been updated to match.</p>

    <p>New features are documented in the CHANGES and NewStuff files.</p>

    <p> All versions of exim
    previous to version <b>4.x</b> are now considered obsolete and
    everyone is  <b>strongly</b> recommended to upgrade to a current
    release.</p>

    <p>The last 3.x release wass <b>3.36</b>.</p>

    <p>There may be beta versions with available from the ftp sites in
    the Testing directory.  Many people are using these without
    problems, but they are not recommended unless you are willing to
    work with beta software.</p>
