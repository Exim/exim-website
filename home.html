    <h1>The Exim Home Page</h1> 

    <p>Exim is a message transfer agent (<b>MTA</b>) developed at the
    University of Cambridge for use on Unix systems connected to the
    Internet. It is freely available under the terms of the <b>GNU
    General Public Licence</b>. In style it is similar to <b>Smail
    3</b>, but its facilities are more general.  There is a great deal
    of flexibility in the way mail can be routed, and there are
    extensive facilities for checking incoming mail. Exim can be
    installed in place of sendmail, although the configuration of exim
    is quite different to that of sendmail.</p>

    <h2>Current Versions</h2>
    <p>
      The current version of Exim is <b>4.40</b>.  See the <a
      href="mirrors.html"><b>Download</b></a> page to get a copy.
      There were a number of issues with earlier <b>4.3x</b> versions 
      so their use is discouraged.  Security fixes in this release 
      mean that all previous versions should be obsoleted in favour
      of 4.34 or 4.40.
    </p>

    <p>Exim 3 and previous versions are now considered obsolete.  Exim 3
    is not being developed any further, nor is it being actively
    maintained, though if a really serious bug were found, it would be
    looked at.</p>

    <p>The old system filter has been deleted from the site - it is
    not appropriate for current mail configurations.  If you are still
    using it please discontinue immediately - it creates severe
    collateral spam issues.</p>

    <h2>Mailman</h2>

    <p>The <a href="howto/mailman21.html">Exim/Mailman HOWTO</a> for
      Mailman 2.1 with Exim 4 has been rewritten.</p>

    <h2>Exim Books</h2> 

    <p>The new <a href="http://www.uit.co.uk/exim-book/"> Exim 4
    book</a> is available.  See the <a
    href="http://www.uit.co.uk/exim-book/">book website</a> for
    further information.</p>

    <p>The O'Reilly <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/exim/">Exim 3
	book</a> is still available.</p>
