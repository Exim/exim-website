In case anybody wants to use a MySql database to store aliases this is
how I managed to get my site working.

1.  I added this line to the main section of
/usr/local/exim/conf/configure (where <password> is the mysql password
for the exim user)

mysql_servers = localhost/school/exim/<password>


2. I then added these lines to the Directors section after the
system_aliases director.

mysql_system_aliases:
  driver = aliasfile
  file_transport = address_file
  pipe_transport = address_pipe
  search_type = mysql
  query = "select userid from user where aliasid='$local_part'"
  user = exim
