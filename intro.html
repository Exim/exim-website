    <h1>Introduction to exim</h1> 

    <p>Exim is a message transfer agent (<b>MTA</b>) developed at the
    University of Cambridge for use on Unix systems connected to the
    Internet. It is freely available under the terms of the <b>GNU
    General Public Licence</b>. In style it is similar to <b>Smail
    3</b>, but its facilities are more extensive, and in particular it
    has some defences against mail bombs and unsolicited junk mail in
    the form of options for refusing messages from particular hosts,
    networks, or senders.</p>

    <p>The major features are summarised below.  There is also an
    overview which expands on these features.  Exim has an extensive
    set of documentation included in the exim specification,
    additionally there are documents on the filtering functionality
    and other documentation is being made available on this web site.
    <a href="exim-html-3.20/doc/html/oview.html">The full overview is also
    available</a>.</p>

    <h2>Basic Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Many configuration options can be given as expansion strings,
	and as these can include file lookups, much of Exim's
	operation can be made table-driven if desired.  For example,
	it is possible to do local delivery on a machine on which the
	users do not have accounts.
      </li>
      <!-- -->
      <li>
	Regular expressions are available in a number of configuration
	parameters.
      </li>
      <!-- -->
      <li>
	Domain lists can include file lookups, making it possible to
	support a large number of local domains.
      </li>
      <!-- -->
      <li>
	The maximum size of message can be specified.
      </li>
      <!-- -->
      <li>
	Exim can handle a number of independent local domains on the
	same machine; each domain can have its own alias files,
	etc. These are commonly called <b>virtual domains</b>.
      </li>
      <!-- -->
      <li>
	Exim contains an optional built-in mail filtering
	facility. This enables users to set up their own mail
	filtering in a straightforward manner without the need to run
	an external program. There can also be a system filter file
	that applies to all messages.
      </li>
      <!-- -->
      <li>
	Periodic warnings are automatically sent to messages' senders
	when delivery is delayed -- the time between warnings is
	configurable.
      </li>
      <!-- -->
      <li>
	A queue run can be manually started to deliver just a
	particular portion of the queue, or those messages with a
	recipient whose address contains a given string.
      </li>
      <!-- -->
      <li>
	Exim can be configured to run as root all the time, except
	when performing local deliveries, which it always does in a
	separate process under an appropriate uid and
	gid. Alternatively, it can be configured to run as root only
	when needed; in particular, it need not run as root when
	receiving incoming messages or when sending out messages over
	SMTP.
      </li>
      <!-- -->
    </ul>
    <h2>Incoming SMTP</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	SMTP calls from specific machines, optionally from specific
	idents, can be locked out, and incoming SMTP messages from
	specific senders can also be locked out.
      </li>
      <!-- -->
      <li>
	Messages on the queue can be `frozen' and `thawed' by the
	administrator.
      </li>
      <!-- -->
    </ul>
    <h2>Outgoing SMTP</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Exim can perform multiple deliveries down the same SMTP
	channel after deliveries to a host have been delayed.
      </li>
      <!-- -->
      <li>
	Exim can be configured to do local deliveries immediately but
	to leave remote deliveries until the message is picked up by a
	queue-runner process. This increases the likelihood of
	multiple messages being sent down a single SMTP connection.
      </li>
      <!-- -->
      <li>
	When copies of a message have to be delivered to more than one
	remote host, up to a configured maximum number of remote
	deliveries can be done in parallel.
      </li>
      <!-- -->
    </ul>
    <h2>Local Deliveries</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Exim stats a user's home directory before looking for a
	`<tt>.forward</tt>' file, in order to detect the case of a
	missing NFS mount.
      </li>
      <!-- -->
      <li>
	There is support for multiple user mailboxes controlled by
	prefixes or suffixes on the user name, either via the
	<i>filter</i> mechanism or through multiple
	`<tt>.forward</tt>' files.
      </li>
      <!-- -->
    </ul>
    <h2>Monitoring and Performance Tools</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	The Exim Monitor is an optional extra; it displays information
	about Exim's processing in an X window, and an administrator
	can perform a number of control actions from the window
	interface.
      </li>
      <!-- -->
      <li>
	There are a set of tools for summarising the queue, determining
	what each exim process is currently doing, examining the
	deliveries hints databases, and summarising the log files into
	a concise report on activity.
      </li>
      <!-- -->
    </ul>
    <h2>SPAM/UCE/UBE Limitation Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Senders can be blocked using a variety of methods, including
	the ability to apply a set of username or regular expression
	patterns to incoming mail from particular (or all) domains.
      </li>
      <!-- -->
      <li>
	All addresses can be checked for validity during the SMTP
	transaction thus allowing the elimination of mail from
	non-existent domains.
      </li>
      <!-- -->
      <li>
	Relaying can be tightly controlled based on sending host,
	network or sending/recipient domains.
      </li>
      <!-- -->
      <li>
	If all else fails the system filter can be used to deal with
	messages based on arbitrary conditions that you can program in
	(for example block mail with a particular <tt>X-Mailer:</tt>
	header.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Exim is written in ANSI C. This should not be much of a
	limitation these days.  However, to help with systems that
	lack a true ANSI C library, Exim avoids making any use of the
	value returned by the `<tt>sprintf()</tt>' function, which is
	one of the main incompatibilities. It has its own version of
	`<tt>strerror()</tt>' for use with <b>SunOS4</b> and any other
	system that lacks this function, and a macro can be defined to
	turn `<tt>memmove()</tt>' into `<tt>bcopy()</tt>' if
	necessary.
      </li>
      <!-- -->
      <li>
	  Exim uses file names that are longer than 14 characters.
	</li>
      <!-- -->
      <li>
	Exim is intended for use as an Internet mailer, and therefore
	handles addresses in RFC 822 domain format only. It cannot
	handle <i>bang paths</i>, though simple two-component bang
	paths can be converted by a straightforward rewriting
	configuration.
      </li>
      <!-- -->
      <li>
	Exim insists that every address it handles has a domain
	attached. For incoming local messages, domainless addresses
	are automatically qualified with a configured domain
	value. Configuration options specify from which remote systems
	unqualified addresses are acceptable.
      </li>
      <!-- -->
      <li>
	The only external transport currently implemented is an SMTP
	transport over a TCP/IP network (using sockets), suitable for
	machines on the Internet. However, a pipe transport is
	available, and there are facilities for writing messages to
	files in `batched SMTP' format; this can be used to send
	messages to some other transport mechanism. Batched SMTP input
	is also catered for.
      </li>
      <!-- -->
    </ul>
