    <h1>Versions of exim</h1>

    <p>The latest release is <b>3.14</b>.  This is an incremental
    upgrade with some new features, however old 3.0x configuration
    files should be fully compatible.  At present it appears there may
    be some problems with this release so production environments
    might be best left on <b>3.13</b></p>

    <p>The previous release is <b>3.14</b>.  This is an incremental
    upgrade with some new features, however old 3.0x configuration
    files should be fully compatible.  Upgrading from previous
    releases is worth doing, particularly since a denial-of-service
    hole has been fixed over 3.0x and lower versions.  This is a well
    trusted version in wide use in production environments.</p>

    <p>The previous release is <b>3.03</b>.  This was a major upgrade
    over the 2.1x series, and some features of the configuration file
    are not backward compatible - although there is a conversion
    utility.  Earlier version <b>3.0x</b> users should upgrade,
    although the bug fixes are relatively minor.</p>

    <p>The last 2.x release version was <b>2.12</b>.  This is a bugfix
    release over earlier 2.1x releases.  Upgrade from 2.0x releases is
    not imperative.</p>

    <p>There were a number of early beta versions of exim with version
    numbers less than <b>1.0</b>.  These should now be avoided.
    Versions earlier than <b>2.0x</b> should also be upgraded.</p>

    <p>There may be beta versions with available from the ftp sites in
    the Testing directory.  Many people are using these without
    problems, but they are not recommended unless you are willing to
    work with beta software.</p>
