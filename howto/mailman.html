    <h1>HOWTO - Using exim and mailman together</h1>

    <p>Mailman is a list manager with web front end and built in
      archiving functions.  Details can be found at <a href="http://www.list.org/">http://www.list.org/</a></p>

    <h2>Mailman configuration</h2>

    <p>There is no mailman configuration needed other than the
    standard options detailed in the mailman install documentation.
    The exim configuration is transparent to mailman.  The uid/gid
    settings for mailman must match those in the config fragments
    given below.</p>

    <h2>Exim configuration</h2>

    <p>The exim configuration is built so that a list created within
    mailman automagically appears to exim without the need for
    additional alias files etc to be changed.</p>

    <p>The drawback of this configuration is that it will work poorly
    on systems supporting lists in several different mail domains -
    for that matter mailman itself has poor support for this right
    now. This may change in the future</p>

    <p>The configuration file segments included are to be built on top
    of an already functional exim configuration, which accepts mail
    for the domain which the list resides in (ie that domain is
    already in <tt>local_domains</tt> - should this domain be separate
    from the others handled by this exim, then add the list domain to
    <tt>local_domains</tt>, add a <tt>domains=my.list.domain</tt>
    option to each of the directors and you may wish to exclude that
    domain from the other directors.</p>

    <p>Your exim configuration also needs a working alias
    configuration, with entries (within the list domain) for
    <tt>mailman</tt>, <tt>mailman-request</tt> and
    <tt>mailman-admin</tt> (plus any other global contact addresses
    for the list master).  These addresses point to a (or some - not
    necessarily the same for all of these aliases) human rather than
    being piped into mailman. You do <b>not</b> need to put per-list
    entries into the system alias file, and doing so will most likely
    break things since the user id used for delivery is likely to be
    incorrect or not set (which causes an exim delivery time config
    error).</p>

    <p>There are 3 config file sections below which need pasting into
    the appropriate parts of the main exim config file.  The first one
    may also need tailoring to your mailman configuration</p>

    <h4>Main config file section</h4>
<pre>
## Top section of config file - macro definitions
## Tailor these to fit your installation
## pretty much everything else should just fit...
##
# home dir for mailman
MAILMAN_HOME=/home/mailman
# wrapper script for mailman
MAILMAN_WRAP=MAILMAN_HOME/mail/wrapper
# user and group for mailman
MAILMAN_UID=exim
MAILMAN_GID=exim
</pre>
    <h4>Transports config file section</h4>
<pre>
## Transports section
##
## Three transports for list mail, request mail and admin mail
## respectively
## Mailman is installed in MAILMAN_HOME
## Mailman is configured to be invoked as user exim
list_transport:
           driver = pipe
           command = MAILMAN_WRAP post ${lc:$local_part}
           current_directory = MAILMAN_HOME
           home_directory = MAILMAN_HOME
           user = MAILMAN_UID
           group = MAILMAN_GID

list_request_transport:
           driver = pipe
           command = MAILMAN_WRAP mailcmd ${lc:$local_part}
           current_directory = MAILMAN_HOME
           home_directory = MAILMAN_HOME
           user = MAILMAN_UID
           group = MAILMAN_GID

list_admin_transport:
           driver = pipe
           command = MAILMAN_WRAP mailowner ${lc:$local_part}
           current_directory = MAILMAN_HOME
           home_directory = MAILMAN_HOME
           user = MAILMAN_UID
           group = MAILMAN_GID

### end of transports section fragment
</pre>
    <h4>Directors config file section</h4>
<pre>
## Directors section [this deals with local addresses]
## 
## First 2 directors rewrite list-owner or owner-list to list-admin
## This is only done if the list exists.
## List existence checks are done by seeing if the file
## MAILMAN_HOME/lists/<list>/config.db
## exists.  

list_owner_director:
   driver = smartuser
   require_files = MAILMAN_HOME/lists/${lc:$local_part}/config.db
   suffix = "-owner"
   new_address = "${lc:$local_part}-admin@${domain}"

owner_list_director:
   driver = smartuser
   require_files = MAILMAN_HOME/lists/${lc:$local_part}/config.db
   prefix = "owner-"
   new_address = "${lc:$local_part}-admin@${domain}"

##
## Next 3 directors direct admin, request and list mail to the appropriate
## transport.  List existence is checked as above.

list_admin_director:
   driver = smartuser
   suffix = -admin
   require_files = MAILMAN_HOME/lists/${lc:$local_part}/config.db
   transport = list_admin_transport

list_request_director:
   driver = smartuser
   suffix = -request
   require_files = MAILMAN_HOME/lists/${lc:$local_part}/config.db
   transport = list_request_transport

list_director:
   driver = smartuser
   require_files = MAILMAN_HOME/lists/${lc:$local_part}/config.db
   transport = list_transport

## End of directors fragment
## End of config files bits
</pre>

<p>Exim should be configured to allow reasonable volume - ie no
setting <tt>max_recipients</tt> down to a silly value, and with normal
degrees of security - ie allowing relaying from <tt>127.0.0.1</tt>
(thats vital), but pretty much nothing else.  Parallel deliveries and
other tweaks can also be used.  Delay warning messages should be
switched off or configured to only happen for non-list mail - unless
you like receiving tons of mail when a host is down.</p>

<h3>Problems</h3>
<ul>

   <li>Mailman's detection of exim bounces needs improving - it really
   should make use of the extra header information that exim provides.
   It also should recognise and deal with or ignore delay warning
   messages.  <i>Mailman 2.0beta does handle exim bounces correctly,
   but still passes delay warnings to the list administrator</i></li>

   <li>List existence is checked on whether there is a config.db file
   for a list.  If you delete lists by foul means, be aware of
   this.</li>

   <li>If you are getting exim or mailman complaining about user ids
   when you send mail to a list, check that the MAILMAN_UID and
   MAILMAN_GID match those of mailman itself.  Also make sure you do
   <b>not</b> have aliases in the main alias file for the list.</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Other Tweaks</h2> 

    <p>One solution passed to me for handling virtual domains was -
    <i>Since I use mailman in a virtual domain configuration with a
    separate installation for each virtual domain, I did a slight
    modification like this:</i></p>

<pre>
## transport configurations

command = "/virtual/${domain}/mailman/mail/wrapper post ${lc:$local_part}"
current_directory = /virtual/${domain}/mailman
home_directory = /virtual/${domain}/mailman

## and in the director part:

require_files = /virtual/${domain}/mailman/lists/${lc:$local_part}/config.db

</pre>

    <h2>Exim List Efficiency Tweaks</h2>

    <p>This is a set of configuration directives I used on the list
    boxes I admin.  Some of these are necessary, others are cosmetic,
    a few are probably superfluous - they work for me!</p>
<pre>
# definition of injecting IP addresses
LOCAL_NETS=127.0.0.1/32
#
# Extra logging data - not necessary but makes the logs more
# useful, but bigger
# lookup all hostnames - puts hostnames into log as well as ips
host_lookup = 0.0.0.0/0
# tweak logging
log_all_parents
log_file_path = /var/log/exim/%s.log
log_received_recipients
log_refused_recipients
log_received_sender
log_smtp_confirmation
#
# RBL settings - these are more severe than I use
rbl_domains = rbl.maps.vix.com/reject:relays.mail-abuse.org/reject:dul.maps.vix.com/reject:relays.orbs.org=127.0.0.2,127.0.0.3/reject
rbl_hosts = !LOCAL_NETS:0.0.0.0/0
rbl_log_rcpt_count
recipients_reject_except=postmaster@*:*-admin@*
#
# relay control - from our local network only
host_accept_relay = LOCAL_NETS
#
# delay warnings - second line is now default, but earlier versions of
# exim need it setting
delay_warning = 26h
##delay_warning_condition = "${if match{$h_precedence:}{(?i)bulk|list|junk}{no}{yes}}"
#
# Verify receipient addresses on everything except local injects
# DO NOT verify addresses from mailman - this would slow down
# the acceptance of messages dramatically
receiver_verify_hosts = !127.0.0.1/8:0.0.0.0/0
sender_verify
#
# performance tweaks - 1st is good for linux, maybe less so for others
split_spool_directory
remote_max_parallel = 15
</pre>

<h2>List verification</h2>

<p>This is how a set of address tests for the exim lists look on a
working system. (command lines start with "&gt;")</p>
<pre>
> /usr/sbin/exim -v -bt exim-users
exim-users@www.exim.org
  deliver to exim-users in domain www.exim.org
  director = list_director, transport = list_transport

> /usr/sbin/exim -bt exim-users-request
exim-users-request@www.exim.org
  deliver to exim-users in domain www.exim.org
  director = list_request_director, transport = list_request_transport

> /usr/sbin/exim -bt exim-users-admin
exim-users-admin@www.exim.org
  deliver to exim-users in domain www.exim.org
  director = list_admin_director, transport = list_admin_transport
