    <h1>The Exim Home Page</h1> 

    <p>Exim is a message transfer agent (<b>MTA</b>) developed at the
    University of Cambridge for use on Unix systems connected to the
    Internet. It is freely available under the terms of the <b>GNU
    General Public Licence</b>. In style it is similar to <b>Smail
    3</b>, but its facilities are more extensive, and in particular it
    has some defences against mail bombs and unsolicited junk mail in
    the form of options for refusing messages from particular hosts,
    networks, or senders.  It can be installed in place of sendmail,
    although the configuration of exim is quite different to that of
    sendmail.</p>

    <p>An expanded <a href="intro.html">introduction is available</a>.</p>

    <h2>New Things</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Exim Version 3.34 is available - see the <a
	href="mirrors.html">availability</a> pages to get hold of a
	copy.  Documentation has been patially updated to match.
	Version 3.34 fixes an exploitable (in rare configurations)
	security bug - upgrading is strongly recommended.
      </li>
      <li>
	Printed copies of the <a href"http://www.bsdmall.com/emexmailtran.html">
	  Exim 3 documentation</a> are available from BSDMall as part of Prime
	Freeware's <a href-"http://ptf.com/dossier/">Dossier</a>
	project (NB this is a printed form of
	documents bundled in electronic form with Exim).
      </li>
      <li>
	The information on the <a href="maillist.html">Mailing
	Lists</a> also now contains a search form.
      </li>
      <li>
	A <b>Generic Windows Executable Content</b> filter is
	available at <a href="ftp://ftp.exim.org/pub/filter/">
	ftp://ftp.exim.org/pub/filter/</a> or <A
	HREF="system_filter.exim">here</A>.  This is an exim system
	filter which attempts to detect executables including the
	types responsible for the Windows/Outlook mail worms, and also
	the recent bugs with header length checking (see this <A
	HREF="http://www.securityfocus.com/frames/?content=/templates/article.html%3Fid%3D61">
	BugTraq article</A>).  It is not infallible, but many sites
	may find it useful.  The file contains installation
	instructions.  Version 0.13 released on 22 May.
      </li>
    </ul>
