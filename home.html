    <h1>The Exim Home Page</h1> 

    <p>Exim is a message transfer agent (<b>MTA</b>) developed at the
    University of Cambridge for use on Unix systems connected to the
    Internet. It is freely available under the terms of the <b>GNU
    General Public Licence</b>. In style it is similar to <b>Smail
    3</b>, but its facilities are more general.  There is a great deal
    of flexibility in the way mail can be routed, and there are
    extensive facilities for checking incoming mail. Exim can be
    installed in place of sendmail, although the configuration of exim
    is quite different to that of sendmail.</p>

    <p>An expanded, although outdated, <a
    href="intro.html">introduction is available</a>.</p>

    <p>Exim 3 and previous versions are now considered obsolete.  Exim 3
