Version 2.12
------------

1. Adjusted scripts/os-type to cope with IRIX 6.5.2m which annoyingly has to be
treated as a different OS.

2. Removed #define SYSCTL_IP_INTERFACES from OS/os.h-IRIX, because this feature
is only in IRIX versions greater than or equal to 6.2.

3. Removed the optimization for copying routing from one address to another
with the same domain. This should have been cut out as soon as the possibility
of using $local_part in router configurations was recognized. Also, using
"unseen" on a router causes problems as well.

4. The use of "unseen" on a router or director was not working properly if
there was a deferment of delivery. Whichever of the unseen/real deliveries
deferred did not get tried again because Exim thought it had delivered the
original address.

5. Error message when remote closed connection had spurious ": NULL" on the end
of it.

6. Eximon: if a message had no undelivered addresses, Eximon was omitting it
from its queue listing.

7. The name of a driver was not being macro-expanded.

8. Remove the old "expiring address" code from smartuser, as it hasn't been
compiled for a long time, and was throwing up comments in Y2K testing.

9. Added USE_DB=yes to the FreeBSD Makefile, since all versions come with
Berkeley DB.

10. Added /usr/include/mit in the XINCLUDE for Ultrix, since some versions need
it.

11. Modified the arch-type script to call uname -m if uname -p returns
"unknown", which apparently happens on some Linux systems.

12. If a forward file contained an unterminated quote or comment, it caused the
address not to be terminated at the end of the line, thus swallowing subsequent
lines.

13. Split the HP-UX configuration files into HP-UX-9 for release 9 and HP-UX
for the current release, which is more POSIX compliant. This has been tested on
release 11.00. Anybody using release 10 may have to fiddle with them.

14. Changed tests on __hpux in the libident library to tests on hpux. This
picks out the pre-POSIX releases of HP-UX where different argument types are
required for select(). In the current release, hpux is, quite correctly, not
defined (__hpux is defined).

15. Fiddled with the dummy functions in various places to stop the picky HP-UX
ANSI compiler from complaining that they were infinite loops.

16. Fixed problem which occurred when a source-routed address was routed to the
local host. It should get rewritten with the first host stripped off; this was
screwing up the original address, causing problems with (a) logging and (b) the
contents of the header file if the delivery was deferred.

17. Added qualify_single and search_parents options to domainlist router.
