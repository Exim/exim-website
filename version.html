    <h1>Versions of exim</h1>

    <p>The latest release is <b>3.15</b>.  This is an incremental
    upgrade with a number of new features, however old 3.0x configuration
    files should be fully compatible.  New features are documented in
    the CHANGES and NewStuff files  Upgrading from previous
    releases is worth doing, particularly since a denial-of-service
    hole has been fixed over 3.0x and lower versions.</p>

    <p>There were a number of early beta versions of exim with version
    numbers less than <b>1.0</b>.  These should now be avoided.
    Versions earlier than <b>2.0x</b> should also be upgraded.
    Version 3.0x releases are also best upgraded.</p>

    <p>There may be beta versions with available from the ftp sites in
    the Testing directory.  Many people are using these without
    problems, but they are not recommended unless you are willing to
    work with beta software.</p>
