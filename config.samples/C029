1. The standard way to connect one's MTA to mailman (and for Majordomo
as well) seems to be to add a set of aliases for *every* list one
creates. Once upon a time, I crufted a set of configs from Smail to
work with majordomo, to automaticaly recognize the standard patterns,
for all lists in existance. I have long since switched to Exim, and
have recently installed Mailman to test on my personal workstation in
preparation for installing it on our main system. To get to the point,
I have setup a set of transports and directors for Exim, which will do
the same thing.
