    <h1>Exim Y2K Information</h1> 

    <p>The author of Exim believes that it is Y2K-compliant, as long
    as the underlying operating system and C library are. Exim does
    not parse dates or times at all.  Internally, it makes some use of
    binary timestamps in Unix format (number of seconds since
    1-Jan-1970) and uses C library services to convert these to
    printing forms (e.g. for logging). The printing forms all use
    4-digit years.</p>

    <p><i>It should be noted that exim, in common with all GNU
	licensed software, does not come with any form of warrenty -
	see the NOTICE and LICENSE files within the distribution.  If
	you need a full Y2K audit performing, then the source is
	available for this to be done.</i></p>

    <h2>Newsflash</h2>
    <p>January 2000 - its still working, no problem reports :-)</p>
