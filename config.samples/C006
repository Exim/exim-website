This is how I have configured a PP-inspired vacationnote, there is (was?)
such a feature in PP. The user makes a file "tripnote" in his/her
homedirectory, the message is passed to the sender once with a short
leading text.

############
# TRANSPORT
vacation_reply:
  driver = autoreply
  file = ${home}/tripnote
  file_expand
  log = ${home}/tripnote.log
  once = ${home}/tripnote.db
  from = vacation@yourdomain.org
  to = $sender_address
  subject = "Re: $h_subject"
  text = "\
  Dear $h_from\n\n\
  This is an automatic reply.  Feel free to send additional\n\
  mail, as only this one notice will be generated.  The following\n\
  is a prerecorded message, sent for ${local_part}@yourdomain.org:\n\
  ====================================================\n\n\

  driver = localuser
  require_files = ${local_part}:${home}/tripnote

  except_senders = "^.*-request@.*:^owner-.*@.*:^postmaster@.*:\
