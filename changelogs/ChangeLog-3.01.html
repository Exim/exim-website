    <h1>Exim changelog for Version 3.01</h1>

    <ol>
      <li>
	Exim wasn't always handling (i.e. ignoring) white space
	following an exclamation mark introducing a negative item in a
	domain, host, or address list.
      </li>
      <li>
	Exim was failing to compile under SunOS4 because on that OS
	getc, ungetc, feof, and ferror are defined only as macros and
	not as assignable functions (which Exim now needs). A suitable
	lash-up has been provided for this operating system.
      </li>
    </ol>
